# AI Assistant Instructions

## Code Development Rules
1. NEVER provide simplified/alternate solutions that reduce functionality
2. NEVER suggest disabling features as a "fix"
3. ALWAYS implement complete, working solutions
4. ALWAYS copy working patterns from existing code in the project
5. ALWAYS provide robust, production-ready implementations
6. NO placeholder comments or "TODO" items
7. NO "Strategy 1, Strategy 2, Strategy 3" approaches - just the working one

## Project Context
- This is a PDF analysis tool using Florence2, Surya, SAM2, and GroundingDINO
- Working components should NEVER be modified
- SAM2 integration should match the patterns in sam2_scripts/
- Focus on completing functionality, not reducing it
